# Rainfall_Predection

🌧️ Rainfall Prediction App

A machine learning–powered Streamlit web application that predicts whether rainfall will occur based on different weather parameters like pressure, humidity, cloud cover, wind speed, etc.

📌 Project Overview

This project uses a Random Forest Classifier trained on weather data to predict rainfall.
The app takes user inputs through a simple UI and outputs whether rainfall is expected or not.
